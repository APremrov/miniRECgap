Description: 'miniRECgap' is a R-package designed for gap-filling of the missing
    eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements with the use of simple user-friendly 
    GUI supported R scripts. The flux-partitioning and gap-filling approaches 
    applied in ‘miniRECgap’ are based on popular simple and robust empirical/semi-empirical 
    modelling.
    Further information on miniRECgap package and its use can be found in the 
    publication by Premrov et al. (in prep. 2024).
